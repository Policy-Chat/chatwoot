# Policy-Chat fork of Chatwoot

This is **Policy-Chat's fork** of [`chatwoot/chatwoot`](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot),
used for the secure web-chat POC (epic **COR-402**). The upstream project
README follows below.

## Pinning

- Our `main` is **pinned to a stable upstream release tag** (currently
  **`v4.19.0`**). We do **not** track upstream `develop`.
- The CI image tag and `CHATWOOT_RELEASE` in
  [`.github/workflows/build-ecr.yml`](.github/workflows/build-ecr.yml) must
  always match the pinned release.

## CI → ECR

- On merge to `main` (and via **Run workflow**), GitHub Actions builds the
  production image from [`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile), scans it with
  **Trivy**, and pushes to the AWS ECR repo **`chatwoot`** (account
  `025425726556`, `us-east-1`).
- Images are tagged **`<release>`** and **`<release>-<shortsha>`** only —
  **never `latest`**.
- Auth is via **GitHub OIDC** into the `chat-poc-gha-chatwoot-ecr` IAM role
  (defined in `Policy-Chat/chat-infra`). No static AWS keys are stored in this
  repo.
- Secrets for the running app come from **AWS Secrets Manager** at runtime (see
  [`.env.production.example`](.env.production.example)); no secret values live
  in this repo.
- **Dependabot** ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml)) keeps
  bundler / npm / docker / actions deps patched between rebases.

## Monthly rebase procedure

Once a month (or when a security release drops), re-pin to the newest stable
upstream tag:

```bash
# 1. Add upstream once (first time only)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot.git || true
git fetch upstream --tags

# 2. Find the newest stable (non-prerelease) tag, e.g. vX.Y.Z
git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail -5

# 3. Rebase our fork's main onto the new release tag
git checkout main
git rebase <vX.Y.Z>
#    (resolve conflicts in any Policy-Chat patches, then `git rebase --continue`)

# 4. Bump the pin in CI to match
#    - edit CHATWOOT_RELEASE in .github/workflows/build-ecr.yml to <vX.Y.Z>
#    - update the "currently vX.Y.Z" note above

# 5. Push; CI builds + scans + pushes the new image to ECR
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

The deploy (COR-420) then rolls the ECS services to the new `<release>` tag.
